We believe that we can help the IoT developers take advantage of the power and productivity of Java by reducing the frictions (licensing costs, field-of-use restrictions) and perceptions (footprint, etc.) gating widespread adoption of the language throughout the IoT.</p>

<p>As members of the Eclipse community we are bringing Zulu and Zulu Embedded – our 100% open source JDKs, to the IoT. Our Zulu products are certified builds of OpenJDK and meet the Java SE standards for Java 8, 7 and 6.  Each release of Zulu and Zulu Embedded has passed the thousands of tests in OpenJDK Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) as well as Azul’s extensive in-house verification suite. Zulu runs on many Linux distros, on Windows and the Mac.</p>

<p>Zulu is a complete Java Development Kit, and Zulu Enterprise provides designers with a choice of storage footprint, bitness (32 or 64-bit configurations), headless or headful, and both development and runtime-only options.</p>
